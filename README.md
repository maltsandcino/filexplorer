# filexplorer

This is an express app using Passport.js and Prisma (on a postgress DB), as well as Supabase, in order to upload and share files to a file-hosting application.

We have authentication and multi-level directories. Directories can be shared for a small amount of time, allowing non-authenticated users to download files at a user's discretion.
